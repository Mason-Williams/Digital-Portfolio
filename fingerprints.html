	<p>HTTPS is a protocal that secures your data transfer between the browser and the website. The "s" in HTTPS stands for secure, making HTTPS the more "secure" version of HTTP. This protocal protects against eavesdropping and MITM attacks. This is done with a HTTPS proxy, which performs encryption and decryption between the client and server, while being undetected by either. MITM stands for "Man in the middle", and these attacks aim to intercept personal data that can later be used to impersonate you. You are most at risk to a MITM attack when connected to a public network.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>A way this can be prevented are hashes. A hash is a cryptographic process used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. For the hash to be good, the value is fully determined by the data being hashed. The hash uses the input data, and then uniformly distributes the data across the entire set of possiblehash value. For this to work, you will need a CA, or a certificate authority. This is a trusted entity that issues SSL certificates. These SSL certificates are data files that are used to cryptographically link an entity with a public key. To prevent your SSL from being intercepted, you can streamline security by automating remediation, not sharing private information, avoiding spam emails, and not visiting suspicious sites. A site can be deemed suspicious if it isn't an HTTPS website.</p>
