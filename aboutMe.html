	<p>My name is Mason Williams, I am currently 16 years old and attending Allen High School. I have 2 sisters, 1 older and 1 younger, which makes me the middle child. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science 2, and wish to pursue a career in somputer science by attending the University of Texas at Dallas. I have had the same dog since 2nd grade, and am planning on taking her to college with me because she is my best friend.</p>
