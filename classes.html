	<p>Some of the classes that I have taken in the path of computer science so far have been Intro to Computer Science my freshman year, and Computer Science 1 in my sophomore year. I am currently in Computer Science 2 as a junior. I will be taking Computer Science 3 my senior year, and hope to major in computer science and engineering throughout college. I got in to computer science because my Grandfather is a software engineer, and seeing the things he gets to do sparked an interest in me.</p>
