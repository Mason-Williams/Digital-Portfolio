	<p>One of the reasons this portfolio is important for me is because I can keep this with me forever. I love coding and computers, so it is super helpful to have this portfolio as a resource to show to future employers. This is also a good way to show my improvment as the years go on, showing that I have learned new things and acually have improved my skills as a coder. It also gives my professors a way to check my progress on different topics, and keep up with my progress overall.</p>
